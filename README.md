# Journal_Bearing

Journal Bearings are widely used for lubrication, and are of great importance in many machines. During working conditions, the lubricant may reach unwanted temperatures due to friction and therefore lose its function and may lead to failure. In this project, we are required to design a journal bearing model and apply required control to prevent the lubricant used (oil) from reaching such temperatures.
